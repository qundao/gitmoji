# wayback-gitmoji

This is an static site, as a backup of [gitmoji.dev](https://gitmoji.dev) by [Carlos Cuesta](https://github.com/carloscuesta).

Here I add Chinese translation of the git emoji (only this, no other pages), most are from the [gitmoji.js.org](https://gitmoji.js.org) by [Jeff Tian](https://github.com/Jeff-Tian). I update it to latest version and adjust some translation words.
